Basic directory structure for assignment3

Once you download the folder, importing it into Eclipse as a Maven project
should set things up.

Assumes '/' as the context root.

How to change the context root in Eclipse?
right click project -> choose 'Properties' -> choose 'Web Project Settings'


How to run the web app:
- right click on the project
- choose 'Run As'
- choose 'Run on Server'
- On the opened browser window go to 'greetingsController.jsp'. I have configured
my Tomcat to run on port 9080. So the link that opens up when the web app is successfully
deployed is 'http://localhost:9080/'

- In order to test the web app, I browse to

http://localhost:9080/greetingsController.jsp
