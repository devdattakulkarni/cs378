Basic directory structure for assignment3

Once you download the folder follow these steps to setup the project.

1) In Eclipse create a new project of type 'Dynamic Web Project'
2) In the project viewer, right click on the project's src directory
3) Click on 'Build Path' and 'Remove from Build Path'
4) Right click on src directory and select 'create folder'
5) Add 'main/java' as the folder within 'src'
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 'test/java' as the folder

After this you should see following directory structure created:
src/main/java
src/test/java

7) Right click the 'java' folder within 'main' folder
8) Click on 'Build Path' and 'Add to Build Path'
9) Repeat steps 7 and 8 for 'java' folder within 'test folder'

After this Eclipse will recognize your java folders as source folders

10) Create 'assign.controllers' package under src/main/java and
src/test/java

11) Add the GreetingsController.java to src/main/java/assign/controllers/GreetingsController.java

12) Copy the pom.xml at the top-most level of the project

17) Right click on the project and select 'Configure Build Path'

How to run the web app:
- right click on the project
- choose 'Run As'
- choose 'Run on Server'
- On the opened browser window go to 'greetingsController.jsp'. I have configured
my Tomcat to run on port 9080. So the link that opens up when the web app is successfully
deployed is 'http://localhost:9080/'

- In order to test the web app, I browse to

http://localhost:9080/greetingsController.jsp
